## Movies manager
A simple movies manager built with Streamlit.

Story: I originally tracked my movie-watching journey in Notion (web). But adding new movies in Notion was painful, and once I had more than 100 movies, it became laggy ðŸ™‚.
So I built this movies manager as a more convenient way to manage my movie collection.

## Tech stack
- UI: Streamlit
- Data: CSV file 
- Visualization: Power BI
- CLI: Click + Rich

## Features
- Full CRUD support (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Track essential metadata: `name`, `year`, `status`, `type`, `country`, `genres`, `rating`, `watched_date`, `note`
- Interactive dashboard with Power BI (Streamlit charts are limited and less interactive compared to Power BI)
- Small CLI for filtering and adding movies

## Notes
- `kdrama` = `series` + `Korea` (similarly, `cdrama` = `series` + `China`)
- `anime` = `animation` + `Japan`
- `romcom` = `romance` + `comedy`
- For privacy reasons, this repo only includes a small sample of my original dataset, stored in `data/data.csv`.
- Remember to refresh all tables to get the latest data in the Power BI report (`dashboard.pbix`).
- Click is bad at handling clickable links, so it recommended to view notes in Streamlit web version instead of CLI.

## Recent updates
- `v0.1.2` - Improved CLI
- `v0.1.1` - Added small CLI
- `v0.1.0` - Data stored in a CSV file
