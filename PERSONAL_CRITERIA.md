### My personal rating criteria 

- **10**: Masterpiece, with high rewatch value
- **9**: Excellent, just missing a bit to be a masterpiece
- **8**: A good watch
- **7**: Enjoyable, but not as good as an 8
- **6**: Decent, with a few flaws, better than average but a waste of potential
- **5**: Average, not enjoyable, but not too bad either
- **4**: Bad, major flaws, though it still has a few redeeming elements
- **3**: Worthless, a complete waste of time, no value - must drop
- **1-2**: Avoided (excluded from charts to maintain visual balance in stacked bar plots)

Recommendation threshold: > **8**

**Why a 10-point scale?**: It simplifies input (reduces cognitive load), aligns with common standards like IMDb, and reflects that a 10-point scale is simply a 5-point scale with half-point increments.


### Criteria for selecting movies/series
- For K-dramas, generally consider titles with a [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/) rating around 8 or higher.


### Notes
- All posts or discussions about "overrated" movies usually mean: *a movie I personally dislike, even if others love it* ðŸ™ƒ.
- Everyone has their own standards, tastes, and preferences. If someone doesnâ€™t like a movie, we canâ€™t make them like it.
